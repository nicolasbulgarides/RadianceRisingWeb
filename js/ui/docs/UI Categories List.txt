Below is a a relatively comprehensive list of UI categories that can be used to categorize UI nodes at a high level.
Note that not all of these categories are present in every game. Most of these individual UI categories
are added over time, not all at once. Note that all UI Categories are formed by a combination of specific "Nodes"
in common UI nomenclature / terminology. For the purposes of our framework, we broadly categorize nodes as either
"Singular" or "Composite" - A singular node might just be a single picture. In reality, these are actually pretty rare, because it is very
rare that a node exists outside of a relationship to other nodes. Loading screens often have text - A Picture + a Text + a loading bar = composite
In real world applications, specialized nodes that are fundamentally single structures and building blocks may be categorized as singular, and a 
composite node might contain numerous singular nodes. A "Label" or text field is a classic singular node, in fact it is built into Babylon.
But, instead of changing text fields directly, we may store text fields in a "singular" node and then reference them in a composite node based
off of specific needs and contexts.
