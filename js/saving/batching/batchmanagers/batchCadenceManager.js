/**
 * BatchCadenceManager
 *
 * Manages the timing (cadence) at which save batches are marked for delivery.
 * Currently contains placeholder logic that should be updated based on
 * actual timing (delivery cadence) requirements. Note thay player cadences will be based on a division by 12
 * where players "cadence core" is 1 to 12, and the delivery of specific batches will be staggered based off this cadence progression
 * A randomization function where the players cadence has a forward and backward tolerance, such that say player with cadence 1
 * can submit an update not at second 12, but randomly between second 8 and second 16, effectively creating a continuous, even
 * organic distribution of player save queries to the database.
 *
 * Also, player cadences will, for convenience, be randomly generated between 1 and 12. Assigning upon account creation is too brittkle
 *  "Load balancing" is more easily served by randomization client side instead of a server side script
