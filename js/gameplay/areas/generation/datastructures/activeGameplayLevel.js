 * - LevelMap: Contains the physical grid layout and board slots
 * - Camera Management: Handles player following and scene visualization
 * - Lighting Management: Controls dynamic lighting effects
 * - Player Management: Tracks active players and their states
 *
 * This class bridges the gap between static level data (LevelDataComposite) and
 * the actual running gameplay instance.
